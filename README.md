## 🤔 FAQ
> **The game freezes frequently, how to fix?**

> **'Unauthorized extension use detected', how to fix?**

> **"Please update extension for best results!" What does this mean??!!!**

Official Download / Update Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRoCoMei3Nc

Calm down jeez. The hack was updated and therefore you need to update. Go to chrome://extensions/ and click remove on the survivio+ extension. Download the new version and load that one as the hack. 

> **What do I do if the cheat stops working?**

Message on discord. If I don't reply it likely means I already know.

> **This feature isn't working for me!**

Some things do not work, only essentials.

> **What is "bump fire"?**

This is a feature for specific non-automatic guns (guns that you cannot hold down the left-click to shoot). By holding down left-click for these guns, they fire at the fastest rate acting like an automatic. (Think of it like an autoclicker.)

> **Why isn't this on the Chrome Web Store?**

This was on the store before, but it got taken down (not sure why). I could try uploading it myself, but this will be the safest route for now.

> **Are pull requests allowed?**

Your contributions are always welcome. If you see something that should be improved or a feature added, feel free to fork this repo and create a PR. 

> **Is the Hack working?**

Check👏for👏yourselves👏
My philosophy is that if I can use the hack without (too many) freezes, there is no problem with it.
